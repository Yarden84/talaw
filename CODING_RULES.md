1. **Don't write comments in the code** unless being asked to do so
2. **Delete any comments in the code** on components you are changing unless specifically being asked not to do so
3. Aspire to write DRY.
4. Use v-for on an object to avoid repeating yourself on template when you can.
5. If you write an element that repeats itself mor than a couple of times on more than one component, make it a reusable component
